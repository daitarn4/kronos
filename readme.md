# KRONOS -- A Time-Sensitive Network Simulation Tool
---

**Kronos** is the an open source project that finds its roots in the need of precisely simulating Time-Sensitive Networks (TSNs), with a good degree of control on the simulated hardware (input FIFO queues, switching fabric, packet tagging, etc.). It is an ongoing project, thus it is very probable that new versions and bug fixes become available frequently.
